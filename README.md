# üß© Microservices Architecture ‚Äî Orders & Invoices

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

This project is a microservices architecture built with **Node.js** and **TypeScript**, integrating services via **RabbitMQ**, with distributed tracing through **OpenTelemetry** and visualization using **Jaeger**. It also uses **PostgreSQL** via **Drizzle ORM**, **Kong API Gateway** for routing and service management, and is fully containerized using **Docker**, with **Pulumi** for infrastructure as code to deploy on AWS.

## üß± Architecture Overview

- **Orders Service**: Exposes HTTP endpoints, persists data into PostgreSQL, and publishes messages to RabbitMQ.
- **Invoices Service**: Listens to the `orders` queue and processes incoming messages.
- **Kong Gateway**: Central API Gateway that routes and controls access to microservices.
- **Observability**: End-to-end tracing implemented with OpenTelemetry and visualized in Jaeger, including context propagation over RabbitMQ.
- **Infrastructure**: Managed with Docker and Pulumi for local and cloud deployments(AWS).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or `npm`
  

First of all you need to have `node` and `yarn`(or `npm`) installed on your machine.

  

_If you decide to use npm don't forget to delete yarn.lock in folders_

  

Then you can clone the repository.

`git clone https://github.com/rafapaivadeandrade/microservices-nodejs`
  

First start the application backend.


1. `cd microservices-nodejs`

1. 1. `cd app-orders`
      
1. 2. `cd app-invoices`
   
2. `yarn` or `npm install`

3. `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
